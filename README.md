# MTB Track Mapping

This research project centered on developing a tool for building detailed, maps of mountain-bike trails by riding them.  
The only sensor inputs are those available on a standard smart-phone.  
The primary algorithms are based on the Multiplicative-Extended Kalman Filter.  
This is topologically consistent formulation of an EKF which correctly handles the group SO(3).
